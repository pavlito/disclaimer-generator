    <p>What is a Terms and Conditions Agreement and is having one important to SaaS companies?</p>
    <p>A <strong>Terms and Conditions Agreement</strong> (T&amp;C) is one of the most important legal documents for companies to include on their web pages and apps. <strong>SaaS</strong>, or Software as a Service, companies provide software through licensing and delivery to companies and customers. Because of this, they need special protections that a T&amp;C can offer.</p>
    <p>To protect your company from potential legal issues and possible risks from providing software and services to your users, including an agreement that relays your rules and regulations to your customers is a <strong>must</strong>. That’s where a Terms and Conditions agreement comes in.</p>

    <h2><span id="What_is_a_Terms_and_Conditions_Agreement">What is a Terms and Conditions Agreement?</span></h2>
    <p>A Terms and Conditions Agreement is an agreement between your company and your users. Once agreed to by your users, a <strong><em>legally binding contract</em></strong> is created.</p>
    <p>These terms lay out the <strong>rules, regulations, and expectations</strong> that a user must follow to use a company’s services or systems. Violations of these rules can mean the ending of the usage, probation, and on some occasions, legal issues.</p>
    <p>While a Terms and Conditions isn’t legally required, it is <strong>highly recommended</strong> for your company to include one. Terms and Conditions, also called <strong>Terms of Use or Terms of Service</strong>, provide protection to your company if any foreseeable legal issues.</p>
    <h2><span id="Why_is_a_Terms_and_Conditions_Agreement_Important_for_SaaS">Why is a Terms and Conditions Agreement Important for SaaS?</span></h2>
    <p><img src="https://www.freeprivacypolicy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/why-is-terms-conditions-agreement-important-saas-02.jpg" alt="Why is a Terms and Conditions Agreement Important for SaaS?" width="1000" height="300" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1481"></p>
    <p>As mentioned above, a Terms and Conditions Agreement isn’t required by law, but is extremely beneficial to have. So why then would your company or app need one?</p>
    <p><strong>First</strong>, Terms and Conditions agreements allow you to control how your customers use and interact with your services.</p>
    <p>SaaS companies deliver a wide variety of services to both companies and consumers. As these services and software programs are associated with the SaaS, having control of the usage is essential. With anyone being able to use your software, laying out your rules clearly is very important.</p>
    <p><a href="https://mailchimp.com/legal/terms/#Rules_and_Abuse">Mailchimp</a> includes some simple, but clear statements of the type of use they don’t allow when using their services in its Standard Terms of Use:</p>
    <p><img src="https://www.freeprivacypolicy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/mailchimp-standard-terms-use-rules-abuse-clause-excerpt.jpg" alt="Mailchimp Standard Terms of Use: Rule and Abuse clause excerpt" width="728" height="364" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1361"></p>
    <p><strong>Second</strong>, a Terms and Conditions allows you to cancel a subscription or use of your service when a customer violates the rules.</p>
    <p>In a Terms and Conditions, you can dictate how your services are used and how usage may be terminated. As customers can use your software for many reasons and on many different applications, stating your reasons for canceling or suspending services may be extremely important in the long run.</p>
    <p>A Terms and Conditions allows you to protect your business from and plan for any future issues if someone decides to file a lawsuit against your company.</p>
    <p>Take a look at the marketing and sales SaaS company <a href="https://legal.hubspot.com/terms-of-service">HubSpot’s</a> Terms of Service. Its section on “Use and Limitations of Use” lays out clear restrictions on how the software can be accessed and used, including attempting to access the services through unapproved platforms:</p>
    <p><img src="https://www.freeprivacypolicy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/hubspot-customer-terms-service-use-limitations-clause-excerpt.jpg" alt="Hubspot Customer Terms of Service: Use and Limitations of Use clause excerpt" width="746" height="620" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1362"></p>
    <p><strong>Third</strong>, you are able to protect your ownership of your product.</p>
    <p>A Terms and Conditions typically includes a section on the company’s ownership rights to their software, copyrights, logos, and domain names of their company. This is commonly referred to as an <strong>Intellectual Property Clause</strong>.</p>
    <p>Maintaining your ownership of these rights is extremely important for companies and especially SaaS apps. You are allowing customers to use your software and in many cases use your logo. In a Terms and Conditions, you clearly state you retain those rights and misuse of them violates your contractual agreement.</p>
    <p>Here is <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/company/customers-partners/terms-of-use/">Zendesk’s</a> Intellectual Property Clause spelling out its ownership and what constitutes a violation of the company’s rights:</p>
    <p><img src="https://www.freeprivacypolicy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/zendesk-website-terms-use-intellectual-property-rights-clause.jpg" alt="Zendesk Website Terms of Use: Intellectual Property Rights clause" width="764" height="384" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1363"></p>
    <p><strong>Fourth</strong>, Terms and Conditions agreements act as risk management for your company in some key ways.</p>
    <p>When writing your Terms and Conditions, the main thing to remember is what potential risks could your company face and how to prevent them. A Terms and Conditions is like preparing for a massive storm. You don’t know exactly what could happen, but you <strong>must prepare for the worst</strong>.</p>
    <p>You can include liabilities against misuse of your services, potential profit losses, or indirect damages faced by your users like the workshare app <a href="https://slack.com/terms-of-service/user">Slack</a> mentions in its Terms of Service:</p>
    <p><img src="https://www.freeprivacypolicy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/slack-user-terms-service-limitation-liability-clause.jpg" alt="Slack User Terms of Service: Limitation of Liability clause" width="646" height="626" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1364"></p>
    <p>As you can see from some of these examples, a T&amp;C is very important for maintaining your rights, limiting your liability, keeping control over how your SaaS is used and keeping your users informed about all of the above.</p>
    <h2><span id="What_Clauses_to_Include_in_Your_Terms_and_Conditions">What Clauses to Include in Your Terms and Conditions</span></h2>
    <p><img src="https://www.freeprivacypolicy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/what-clauses-to-include-in-your-terms-conditions-02.jpg" alt="What Clauses to Include in Your Terms and Conditions" width="1000" height="300" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1482"></p>
    <p>Not every Terms and Conditions is written the same or includes the same clauses. You should draft your T&amp;C specifically for your company and services. Sticking only to a preprinted or constructed form may not fully protect your company, but using a template could be a good place to start to build off of.</p>
    <p>There are some <strong>key clauses</strong> that your Terms and Conditions should include: </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Statement of creation of legally binding agreement</li>
        <li>Eligibility of using your services</li>
        <li>Licensing information and limitation of uses</li>
        <li>Termination of usage by either the company or by user</li>
        <li>Intellectual Property</li>
        <li>User-generated content</li>
        <li>Payment of services and usage</li>
        <li>Limitation of Liability</li>
        <li>Governing law of terms</li>
        <li>Modification or updates to terms</li>
        <li>Contact information of your company or app</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Let’s take a look at these in more detail.</p>
    <h3>Blockquote Design</h3>
    <blockquote>
        <p>
            <em>“The supervisory authority shall establish and make public a list of the kind of processing operations which are subject to the requirement for a data protection impact assessment pursuant to paragraph 1. The supervisory authority shall communicate those lists to the Board referred to in Article 68.”</em></p><em>
        </em>
        <p><em>“The supervisory authority may also establish and make a public a list of the kind of processing operations for which no data protection impact assessment is required. The supervisory authority shall communicate those lists to the board.”</em>
        </p>
    </blockquote>
    <h3><span id="Legally_Binding_Statement">Legally Binding Statement</span></h3>
    <p>While not necessarily a clause, including a note stating that agreement to your terms constitutes a “<strong><em>legally binding contract</em></strong>” is of utmost importance.</p>
    <p>This statement is generally included right at the beginning of the terms and bolded to draw the reader’s attention.</p>
    <p>Slack’s statement notifies its users by bolding their notification and using plain and informal language to not confuse the reader. </p>
    <p><img src="https://www.freeprivacypolicy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/slack-user-terms-service-legally-binding-clause.jpg" alt="Slack User Terms of Service: Terms are Legally Binding clause" width="664" height="331" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1366"></p>
    <p>Why is this statement important? Not everyone is an attorney, a business person, or even fully reads every notification pop-up. Having your statement at the beginning makes them immediately aware that they are entering a legal contract and they could face consequences for violating the rules.</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.docusign.com/company/terms-and-conditions/web">DocuSign</a> includes a statement entirely in bold explaining what acceptance of this agreement means and places it at the beginning of its T&amp;C:</p>
    <p><img src="https://www.freeprivacypolicy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/docusign-terms-conditions-accept-clause-excerpt.jpg" alt="Docusign Terms and Conditions: Accept Terms clause excerpt" width="742" height="385" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1367"></p>
    <h3><span id="Eligibility_of_Usage_of_Services">Eligibility of Usage of Services</span></h3>
    <p>This clause isn’t always included in every SaaS Terms and Conditions. However, you should consider including one. This is because users of apps and the internet are not always adults and the country your company is based in may have restrictions on the types of users you can have.</p>
    <p>Most eligibility clauses are also at the beginning of the terms and generally include many of these restrictions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Of legal age wherever you live</li>
        <li>Not live in a country embargoed by the US (or another country)</li>
        <li>Agree to the terms</li>
        <li>Complete registration (if applicable)</li>
        <li>Provide updated billing information (if applicable)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Mailchimp includes most of these restrictions as their software is generally used by bloggers and internet companies in a wide variety of countries</p>
    <p><img src="https://www.freeprivacypolicy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/mailchimp-standard-terms-use-eligibility-clause.jpg" alt="Mailchimp Standard Terms of Use: Eligibility of Use clause" width="726" height="599" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1368"></p>
    <p>Including this clause adds another level of control and protection for your company by dictating who can use your products.</p>
    <p>Another more detailed example with additional restrictions can be seen from <a href="https://www.shopify.com/legal/terms">Shopify</a>:</p>
    <p><img src="https://www.freeprivacypolicy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/shopify-terms-service-account-clause-excerpt.jpg" alt="Shopify Terms of Service: Account Terms clause excerpt" width="591" height="524" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1369"></p>
    <h3><span id="Licensing_Information_and_Limitation">Licensing Information and Limitation</span></h3>
    <p>Probably the <strong>most important clause</strong> in your Terms and Conditions in the one addressing prohibited uses of your services. This clause should include clear and explicit restrictions on what your customer can do and how your customer can interact with your products and software.</p>
    <p>This clause is essential to making sure you control the usage of your products, but can also protect you from possible future risks. Some of these restrictions may be common among other SaaS companies, but you should make sure to tailor your terms to your specific company and products. They also include how much license and rights the user has to the software or services.</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.twilio.com/legal/tos#3-access-and-use-of-the-services">Twilio</a> limits its users to very few applications and uses of the software:</p>
    <p><img src="https://www.freeprivacypolicy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/twilio-terms-service-access-use-clause.jpg" alt="Twilio Terms of Service: Access and Use of the Services clause" width="484" height="553" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1370"></p>
    <p>If you have more restrictions than can fit in a simple paragraph, like <a href="https://help.github.com/en/articles/github-terms-of-service#c-acceptable-use">GitHub</a>, including links to a separate page for acceptable use and policies should be included. This helps keep your main T&amp;C organized and digestible while making sure your users can find detailed, thorough information if they want to:</p>
    <p><img src="https://www.freeprivacypolicy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/github-terms-service-acceptable-use-clause.jpg" alt="GitHub Terms of Service: Acceptable Use clause " width="732" height="334" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1371"></p>
    <p>Specific licenses and whether you can duplicate, copy, or sell the services can also included in this section as <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/terms/?nc1=f_pr">Amazon Web Services</a> does in its terms:</p>
    <p><img src="https://www.freeprivacypolicy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/amazon-web-services-terms-use-license-site-access-clause.jpg" alt="Amazon Web Services Terms of Use: License and Site Access clause" width="895" height="389" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1372"></p>
    <h3><span id="Termination_of_Usage">Termination of Usage</span></h3>
    <p>The termination of use of services varies depending on the company. This section usually includes how your company or your users may terminate the use, for cause and sometimes without cause.</p>
    <p>The clause acts as a <strong>notification</strong> to your user that you may stop usage at any point and that you are not liable for any issues arising out of this cancellation.</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.oracle.com/legal/terms.html">Oracle’s</a> Termination of Use clause is short, but to the point:</p>
    <p><img src="https://www.freeprivacypolicy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/oracle-terms-use-termination-clause.jpg" alt="Oracle Terms of Use: Termination clause" width="1000" height="147" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1373"></p>
    <p>The termination section can also be extensive depending on all of the services you provide or if there are multiple users who have access to the software.</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.adobe.com/legal/terms.html">Adobe</a> includes its general termination terms for single users:</p>
    <p><img src="https://www.freeprivacypolicy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/adobe-terms-use-termination-you-us-clause-excerpt.jpg" alt="Adobe Terms of Use: Termination by You and by Us clause excerpt" width="1000" height="252" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1374"></p>
    <p>It also includes information about termination by Group Administrators:</p>
    <p><img src="https://www.freeprivacypolicy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/adobe-terms-use-termination-group-administrator-clause.jpg" alt="Adobe Terms of Use: Termination by Group Administrator clause" width="1000" height="55" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1375"></p>
    <h3><span id="Intellectual_Property">Intellectual Property</span></h3>
    <p>Protecting your copyrights, patents, trademarks, and more is very important for companies, especially internet and mobile apps. For SaaS companies, it is even more important.</p>
    <p>Including a clause about the retention of those rights protects your company’s business and financial future. Since the nature of SaaS companies is providing downloadable software to multiple users who use the services in multiple ways, and can even display your trademark, it is pertinent to lay out your rules.</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.servicenow.com/terms-of-use.html#intellectual">ServiceNow</a> breaks down not only the intellectual property rights for the website, but also for the content and services provided: </p>
    <p><img src="https://www.freeprivacypolicy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/servicenow-terms-use-intellectual-property-website-clause-excerpt.jpg" alt="ServiceNow Terms of Use: Intellectual Property - Website clause excerpt" width="769" height="316" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1376"></p>
    <p>You can also include a link to a larger policy protecting your intellectual rights and the ramifications of any violation or query into any infringement as <a href="https://squareup.com/us/en/legal/general/ua">Square</a> does:</p>
    <p><img src="https://www.freeprivacypolicy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/square-terms-service-intellectual-property-infringement-clause.jpg" alt="Square Terms of Service: Intellectual Property Infringement clause" width="708" height="200" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1377"></p>
    <h3><span id="User-Generated_Content">User-Generated Content</span></h3>
    <p>A <strong>&gt;user-generated content clause</strong> is not always applicable to every SaaS company. User-generated content is when your company allows users to add their own personally created content to your webpage, blog posts, comments, or social media. Allowing this content can be a boost to your company, but can also come with pitfalls.</p>
    <p>Allowing offensive content, using pictures unlawfully, etc., can lead to potential risk management issues.</p>
    <p>You should create a clause that outlines the restrictions and type of content you allow, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Ownership of content rules</li>
        <li>Guidelines</li>
        <li>Copyright infringement</li>
        <li>Lawfulness of content</li>
        <li>Not allowing defamatory or offensive content</li>
        <li>Content that is damaged or has viruses</li>
    </ul>
    <p><a href="https://www.sophos.com/en-us/legal/sophos-website.aspx">Sophos</a> allows its users to post to the company blog. However, it imposes strict restrictions on the type of content and how it may be posted:</p>
    <p><img src="https://www.freeprivacypolicy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/sophos-terms-use-uploading-content-blog-clause.jpg" alt="Sophos Terms of use: Uploading Content to the Site and Use of the Blog clause" width="672" height="610" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1378"></p>
    <p>Another example of an extensive user-generated content is from one of the largest SaaS companies, <a href="https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en-US#toc-content">Google</a>:</p>
    <p><img src="https://www.freeprivacypolicy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/google-terms-service-user-generated-content-clause.jpg" alt="Google Terms of Service: User generated content clause" width="579" height="494" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1379"></p>
    <h3><span id="Payment_of_Services_and_Usage">Payment of Services and Usage</span></h3>
    <p>Some SaaS companies do not require payment of their services or software. However, if you require your users to subscribe or pay for the download or additional services, you must include a <strong>payment service and fees section</strong>.</p>
    <p>Included in this section are terms for how users pay for the services, updating billing, and warranting that the information you provided is accurate.</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.logmeininc.com/legal/terms-and-conditions">LogMeIn’s</a> Payment and Fees Section also includes actions they may take if you fail to pay or the information is inaccurate. </p>
    <p><img src="https://www.freeprivacypolicy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/logmein-terms-conditions-orders-fees-payment-clause-excerpt.jpg" alt="LogMeIn Terms and Conditions: Orders Fees and Payment clause excerpt" width="867" height="494" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1380"></p>
    <p>There are some services provided that may be subject to taxes. Survey generator company <a href="https://www.logmeininc.com/legal/terms-and-conditions">SurveyMonkey</a> has a payment clause that includes a section about taxes that may need to be paid by the user and releasing its responsibility for that payment:</p>
    <p><img src="https://www.freeprivacypolicy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/surveymonkey-terms-use-taxes-clause.jpg" alt="SurveyMonkey Terms of Use: Taxes clause" width="755" height="539" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1381"></p>
    <h3><span id="Limitation_of_Liability">Limitation of Liability</span></h3>
    <p>A Terms and Conditions is meant to help you prevent future risk management issues. One of the sections that is directly applicable to this is the limitation of liability clause.</p>
    <p>In the clause, you can state your limitation to issues with third-parties, issues arising from using their site, any lost financials or property and other potential issues.</p>
    <p>Here’s how <a href="https://www.workday.com/en-us/legal/site-terms.html">Workday</a> does this in its Liability clause:</p>
    <p><img src="https://www.freeprivacypolicy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/workday-terms-use-limitation-liability-clause.jpg" alt="Workday Terms of Use: Limitation of Liability clause" width="1000" height="171" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1382"></p>
    <p>This clause is often fully bolded or capitalized to clearly notify the user of these limits of liability. <a href="https://zoom.us/terms">Zoom</a> capitalizes the entire section in its terms:</p>

    <h3><span id="Governing_Law">Governing Law</span></h3>
    <p>Legal issues inevitably will occur. However, not every state or jurisdiction has the same laws. Including a governing law clause for your website and services allows you to dictate where any potential future legal actions will be filed.</p>
    <p>This may seem like an unnecessary clause, but the jurisdiction can have major implications if their laws are favorable or unfavorable to your issue.</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.knowbe4.com/terms">KnowBe4</a> declares Florida as the governing law for any future lawsuits or disputes and even includes the specific state courts where you would have to file:</p>

    <h3><span id="Modification_or_Updates_to_the_Terms">Modification or Updates to the Terms</span></h3>
    <p>Companies are constantly modifying their terms as technology advances or new services are provided.</p>
    <p>A <strong>modification to terms clause</strong> puts your users on notice of <strong><em>when</em></strong> terms may change and that they <strong><em>may</em></strong> change. <a href="https://buffer.com/legal">Buffer</a> even goes as far as to include date ranges of when changes will come into effect:</p>

    <p><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/terms">Dropbox</a> lays out its right to modify the terms and let users know they will be notified by email to any of these changes, allowing the user to accept or reject the new terms:</p>

    <h3><span id="Contact_Information_and_How_to_Contact">Contact Information and How to Contact</span></h3>
    <p>Your users need to be able to contact your company if any issue arises. It is helpful to include a section containing your company’s contact information such as address, phone number, and/or email address.</p>
    <p>This section is usually included at the bottom of the terms as it is a common place consumers would look. <a href="https://www.pardot.com/legal/site-terms-of-service/">Pardot</a> includes full contact information if any of its users need help or have concerns:</p>
    <p><img src="https://www.freeprivacypolicy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/pardot-terms-use-contact-details-clause.jpg" alt="Pardot Terms of Use: Contact details clause" width="759" height="147" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1387"></p>
    <p>Note how it includes a mailing address and email address to allow for multiple methods of contact. This helps make the company accessible to more users.</p>
    <h2><span id="How_to_Display_and_Get_Agreement_to_Your_Terms_and_Conditions">How to Display and Get Agreement to Your Terms and Conditions</span></h2>
    <p><img src="https://www.freeprivacypolicy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/how-to-display-get-agreement-to-your-terms-conditions-02.jpg" alt="How to Display and Get Agreement to Your Terms and Conditions" width="1000" height="300" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1483"></p>
    <p>Links to your Terms and Conditions should be clear and easily accessible.</p>
    <p>There are multiple locations of where you can include your link, depending on whether your user is accessing your website or your mobile app. You can include them in: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The footer of your website</li>
        <li>In the actual desktop or web app in the Settings or other relevant menu</li>
        <li>Legal/About menu in mobile apps</li>
    </ul>
    <p><a href="https://www.zendesk.com/">Zendesk</a> includes a link in the most common place, in the footer of its website:</p>

    <p>In Google applications on your computer you can access the T&amp;C in the About Google or About Chrome section under Settings when you have the application open:</p>
    <p><img src="https://www.freeprivacypolicy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/google-chrome-settings-help-section-screenshot.jpg" alt="Google Chrome Settings Help section screenshot" width="714" height="171" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1390"></p>
    <p>In <a href="https://www.adobe.com/legal/terms.html">Adobe’s</a> Photoshop or Lightroom apps you can find links to the Terms and Conditions in the About PS or About Lightroom section within the “Legal” section:</p>
    <p><img src="https://www.freeprivacypolicy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/adobe-ps-express-app-settings-menu-screenshot.jpg" alt="Adobe PS Express app: Settings menu screenshot" width="394" height="700" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1391"></p>
    <h3><span id="Getting_Agreement">Getting Agreement</span></h3>
    <p>A Terms and Conditions Agreement is legally binding, <strong>once there is agreement</strong>. If you <strong>do not</strong> receive agreement by the user, than the Terms and Conditions <strong>isn’t enforceable</strong> and in any future legal issues that arise the Terms and Conditions won’t be applicable.</p>
    <p>You should include a clearly labeled “Accept” button for your Terms and Conditions or use a checkbox for the user to actively check for acceptance of the terms. These acceptance options are typically included in pop-ups, emails, or on sign-up forms.</p>
    <p>An example of an “Accept” button or “Sign Up” button can be seen on Adobe’s sign-up form for new accounts:</p>
    <p><img src="https://www.freeprivacypolicy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/adobe-account-sign-up-screen.jpg" alt="Adobe accoutn sign-up screen" width="477" height="576" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1392"></p>
    <p><a href="https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/login/signup?apintent=generic">MuleSoft</a> is an example of including an unchecked box for your new users to create an account:</p>
    <p><img src="https://www.freeprivacypolicy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/mulesoft-create-account-screen-checkbox-agree-terms-privacy-policy.jpg" alt="MuleSoft Create Account screen with checkbox to agree to Terms and Privacy Policy" width="436" height="658" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1393"></p>
    <p><strong>Note</strong>: As you might have noticed, many of these agreements are displayed before the user has access to the software or service. A user <strong>must</strong> accept your terms before they even use your products. If they don’t, there could potentially be issues later.</p>
    <h2><span id="Summary">Summary</span></h2>
    <p>In summary, while not legally required, including a Terms and Conditions Agreement for your SaaS’s website is highly recommended and exceptionally beneficial.</p>
    <p>A Terms and Conditions allows your company to dictate your rules for the usage of your software and services, protects your ownership rights in your products, and helps prevent possible risks down the road.</p>
    <p>Making sure you cover all of your bases by including important clauses will protect you if an issue arises. Always get users to agree to it, and make sure it’s displayed consistently for users to access at any time, both before and after signing up with your SaaS.</p>
    <p>Remember, you may not know what is coming, but you need to prepare for everything and protect your company.</p>
